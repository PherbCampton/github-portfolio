## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the following libraries and resources that have been instrumental in the development of this project:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): The backbone of our project, React provides a powerful and efficient way to build user interfaces. We couldn't have done it without the React community.

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): Thanks to React Router, our project benefits from efficient client-side routing, making navigation seamless and intuitive.

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): Axios has been a reliable HTTP client for making API requests, enabling our project to interact with external data sources.

- [React Error Boundary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-error-boundary): The React Error Boundary library played a significant role in creating reusable React error boundary component. Supports all React renderers (including React DOM and React Native).

- [Other dependencies]: I am grateful to the open-source community for various other dependencies that have contributed to the functionality and aesthetics of this project. Check the `package.json` file for a full list of dependencies.

This project wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic work of these libraries and the broader developer community. Thank you all for your hard work and contributions!
